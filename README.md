# car-price-prediction-using-KNN
In this project I demonstrate how we can use a simple KNN algorithm to predict car prices. I implement univariate and multivariate KNN model. I also show how we can implement K-folds cross validation.
You can find the dataset I've used using this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data
